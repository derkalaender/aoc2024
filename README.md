# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2024
***A different language each day***

## Overview
Here you'll find my âœ¨solutionsâœ¨ to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) puzzles.
I'll be solving each puzzle in a *different language*, just for fun.
I'll start with languages I'm already familiar with, but maybe I'll go crazy later on.

The project is structured as follows:
- Source code for each day is in a separate folder `days/dayXX`.
- Input data is in `inputs/dayXX.txt`. Input data is not included in the repository!
