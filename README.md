# üéÑ Advent of Code 2024

***A different language each day***

## Overview

Here you'll find my ‚ú®solutions‚ú® to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) puzzles.
I'll be solving each puzzle in a *different language*, just for fun.
I'll start with languages I'm already familiar with, but maybe I'll go crazy later on.

The project is structured as follows:

- Source code for each day is in a separate folder `days/dayXX`.
- Input data is in `inputs/dayXX.txt`. Input data is not included in the repository!

## How to Run

Each program accepts the path to the input file as its argument.

Simply call/compile the source code for that day and invoke it with the path to the input file.

It will write the answer to both parts to `stdout` like so:

```
Answer 1: 123
Answer 2: 456
```
